`@select`
A select expression of the form:
```julia
@select begin
     clause1 => body1
     clause2 => body2
     _       => default_body
    end
end
```
Wait for multiple clauses simultaneously using a pattern matching syntax, taking a different action depending on which clause is available first.
A clause has three possible forms:
1) `event |> value`
If `event` is an `AbstractChannel`, wait for a value to become available in the channel and assign `take!(event)` to `value`.
if `event` is a `Task`, wait for the task to complete and assign `value` the return value of the task.
2) `event |< value`
Only suppored for `AbstractChannel`s. Wait for the channel to capabity to store an element, and then call `put!(event, value)`.
3) `event`
Calls `wait` on `event`, discarding the return value. Usable on any "waitable" events", which include channels, tasks, `Condition` objects, and processes.

If a default branch is provided, `@select` will check arbitrary choose any event which is ready and execute its body, or will execute `default_body` if none of them are.

Otherise, `@select` blocks until at least one event is ready.

For example,

```julia
channel1 = Channel()
channel2 = Channel()
task = @task ...
result = @select begin
    channel1 |> value => begin
            info("Took from channel1")
            value
        end
    channel2 <| :test => info("Put :test into channel2")
    task              => info("task finished")
end
```

"""
`select(clauses[, block=true]) -> (clause_index, clause_value)`

Functional form of the `@select` macro, intended to be used when the set of clauses is dynamic. In general, this method will be less performant than the macro variant.

Clauses are specified as an array of tuples. Each tuple is expected to have 2 or 3 elements, as follows:

1) The clause type (`:take` or `:put`)
2) The waitable object
3) If the clause type is `:put`, the value to insert into the object.

If `block` is `true` (the default), wait for at least one clause to be satisfied and return a tuple whose first elmement is the index of the clause which unblocked first and whose whose second element is the value of the clause (see the manual on `select` for the meaning of clause value).

Otherwise, an arbitrary available clause will be executed, or a return value of `(0, nothing)` will be returned  immediately if no clause is available.
